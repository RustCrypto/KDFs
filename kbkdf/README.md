Pure Rust implementation of the Key Based Key Derivation Function (KBKDF).
This function is described in section 4 of [NIST SP 800-108r1, Recommendation
for Key Derivation Using Pseudorandom Functions](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-108r1.pdf).

# Usage

The most common way to use KBKDF is as follows: you generate a shared secret with other party
(e.g. via Diffie-Hellman algorithm) and use key derivation function to derive a shared key.

```rust
use hex_literal::hex;
use hmac::Hmac;
use kbkdf::{Counter, Kbkdf};
use sha2::Sha256;

type HmacSha256 = Hmac<Sha256>;
let counter = Counter::<HmacSha256, HmacSha256>::default();
let key = counter
    .derive(b"secret", true, true, true, b"label", b"")
    .unwrap();
assert_eq!(
    key,
    hex!(
        "ff6a1e505e0f2546eae8f1e11ab95ff6"
        "47b78bb2182a835c7c1f8054ae7cfea5"
        "8182da6b978c411fa840326ebbe07bfc"
        "aaef01c090bb6f8e9c1da9dedf40bc3e"
    )
);
```
